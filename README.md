# 📦 Smart Inventory Demand Forecasting System

A data science project that helps businesses predict future product demand using historical data, improving inventory management and reducing costs. Perfect for **retail chains**, **e-commerce platforms**, and **FMCG companies**.

---

## 🚀 Project Objective

This project aims to develop a **machine learning model** that predicts future demand for products across various locations. The goal is to help businesses:
- 📉 Minimize overstock and understock issues
- 💰 Optimize storage and purchasing costs
- 🛒 Improve customer satisfaction by reducing stockouts

## 🔍 Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning & Encoding**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
3. **Feature Engineering**
4. **Model Training & Testing**
5. **Error Evaluation (MAE, RMSE)**
6. **Visualization of Predictions**

---

## 📈 Model Performance

- ✅ **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error): ~10–15 units (on sample data)
- ✅ **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error): ~15–20 units
- ✨ Great for short-term and seasonal forecasting
